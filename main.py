Catherine said the Queen had held Christmas close to her heart as a time that reminded us of the importance of faith, friendship and family. People recognised for showcasing community values were invited to the service at Westminster Abbey. It is the first royal carol service since the Queen died in September. The Together at Christmas event was held on 15 December, and was supported by the Royal Foundation, a charity founded and run by the Prince and Princess of Wales"
